## Why Zoi is different

Zoi uses complex machine learning algorithms to figure out the current mental states. It provides the users with temporary solutions in the forms of games and music as well as provides long term solution such as recommendations in diet as well suggestions with regards to physical exercise.

Zoi stands out because of its dynamic nature and the methodical solutions it provides to the user.

In future we would like to integrate zoi with a chat bot as well as provide premium services the users like taking to certified health care experts which would be subscription based. This would be our primary revenue model.
